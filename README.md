Concerning the project : 

*U-Net for Cardiac MRI Segmentation*

This project builds upon the IMA205 challenge and focuses on the segmentation of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using the U-Net architecture. In the challenge, anatomical segmentations derived from cardiac MRI were provided (left ventricle, right ventricle, and myocardium masks) and demonstrated their utility in computer-aided diagnosis of cardiac pathologies.

In this project, we will employ deep learning techniques, specifically the popular U-Net architecture, to learn and perform segmentation on cardiac images. The objective is to explore the impact of various augmentations and test-time augmentations on segmentation performance. Additionally, if time permits, we will evaluate the generalization of the deep learning approach by incorporating additional datasets. Furthermore, supervised and semi-supervised alternatives will be considered, potentially utilizing contrastive losses to enhance the learning process.

This project offers an opportunity to gain hands-on experience with deep learning, medical image analysis, and cardiac MRI segmentation. It provides a platform to investigate advanced techniques and assess the performance and generalization of deep learning models in this specific domain.

Image Restoration and Computational Photography

This course is divided into two parts, focusing on different aspects of image processing and computational photography techniques.

Part 1: Methodological Approaches
The first part of the course explores two central tools in image restoration and editing: patch-based methods and generative neural networks. Patch-based methods leverage the assumption that local neighborhoods in digital images (patches) exhibit self-similarity properties that can be exploited to enhance image quality. Generative networks, including autoencoders and generative adversarial networks (GANs), enable image enhancement or synthesis by training on large databases.

Part 2: Computational Photography Applications
The second part of the course presents various applications from the field of computational photography, which aims to overcome the limitations of imaging devices through algorithmic means. The methodological approaches introduced earlier will be implemented within this context.

The following applications will be covered in detail:

- High Dynamic Range (HDR) Imaging: Techniques for capturing and processing images with a wide dynamic range, resulting in visually appealing and realistic representations.
- Image Deconvolution: Methods for restoring images affected by blurring or other degradations, aiming to recover fine details and improve overall sharpness.
- Inpainting: Techniques for filling in missing or damaged parts of an image using information from the surrounding areas, leading to seamless reconstructions.
These topics will provide students with a comprehensive understanding of image restoration methods and their practical applications in computational photography.
